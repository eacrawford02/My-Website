What to expect from this? Well, not much. While I do have a direction in mind for where I’d like to take this, consistently writing down my thoughts outside of an academic setting is a fairly new concept for me, so only time will tell how this writing space will unfold. If anything, it’ll be a good measure of my persistence, as well as a way for me to brush up on my writing skills. My intention for this, though, is to serve primarily as a more detailed documentation of myself—of my thoughts, views, and memories; things that can’t be captured in photographic form. I want what I write and share with the world to be personal and deeply reflective, so expect everything that appears here to embody that sentiment.

Maybe it would also be a good idea to state what *not* to expect from this. I don’t plan on committing to any set schedule as, speaking from experience, such a commitment would (eventually) become an empty promise. The content and style of what I write will most likely also vary, and for good reason too. Much of it will most likely be informal musings, although I think it would be nice to have the occasional more formal piece of writing or, even better, something with a bit more of an artistic tone.
With all that being said, I ultimately hope that my writing is, at the very least, interesting for somebody. Let’s see if I can do that.
