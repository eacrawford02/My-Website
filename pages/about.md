Hi, I'm Ewen Crawford, and I'm currently a first year engineering student at
Queen's University. I have a passion for writing code that is concise, structured, and well thought out, with a focus specifically on graphics and game engine programming.


When not studying or creating programs, I enjoy spending my time taking photos, listening to music, or watching films.
